  This plugin aims to bring some awesomeness of
  fuzzy openers like emacs-helm and ctrlp.vim to yi.


Setup
=====

  This plugin provides a single function **fuzzyOpen**.

  Refer to yi's example config for your preferred keymap
  to see how to bind keys to actions.

  For emacs and cua it will probably look like this:

    (ctrlCh 'p' ?>>! fuzzyOpen)

  And for vim keymap something like this:

    V.mkStringBindingY V.normal ("<C-p>", fuzzyOpen, id)

Usage
=====

  <C-p> (or whatever mapping user chooses) starts fuzzy open dialog.

  Typing something filters filelist.

  <Esc> and <C-g> cancel the dialog.

  <Enter> opens currently selected file
  in current (one that fuzzyOpen was initiated from) window.

  <C-t> opens currently selected file in a new tab.
  <C-s> opens currently selected file in a split.

  <KUp> and <C-p> move selection up
  <KDown> and <C-n> move selection down

  Readline shortcuts <C-a> , <C-e>, <C-u> and <C-k> work as usual.

Support
=======

  Don't hesitate to file an issue on github or come by #yi@freenode.
